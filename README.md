The e-HMS aims to provide a unified, user-friendly platform addressing data administration, communication, security, accessibility, and standardization issues, ultimately enhancing patient care and expediting healthcare procedures. This project aims to design, develop, test, and implement the electronic healthcare management system on the Laravel framework. With an exploration of the existing healthcare management landscape, highlighting key issues such as security, scalability, and user interface complexity, the HMS project proposes solutions to these challenges, leveraging modern technologies to streamline healthcare processes and improve patient care, The insights gained from this study are crucial for patients and healthcare providers in the healthcare systems, ultimately enhancing the quality of healthcare management in the digital age.
